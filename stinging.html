			<h1 id="title1">How Jellyfish Sting</h1>
			<h2 class="title MainParagraph">The main reason why jellyfish are known around the world is because of their sting. Their sting has many uses including warding off predators and paralyzing prey. These stings can be harmless to humans, but some stings can be very lethal. How does a jellyfish sting? What is the deadliest sting?</h2>

						<p class="info">Jellyfish use venom as a main defensive tactic. When something comes into contact with the jellyfish, the jellyfish releases venom. This venom is used to stun/kill food and to ward off dangerous threats.</p>
						
						<p class="info">Jellyfish have thousands of cells called cnidocytes and nematocysts. These are the stinging cells of the jellyfish. These cells are located all over the body. Most jellyfish have stinging cells on their tentacles. However, some types of jellyfish have stinging cells on their bell too. When something stimulates the outer parts of the cell (whether it be predator, prey or an inanimate object), the cell opens and a small, microscopic harpoon is ejected from the cell. The harpoon then pierces and injects venom into the object.</p>

						<p class="info">Jellyfish venom could be harmless. Moon jellyfish are a very popular species of jellyfish because they are harmful to humans. However, some types of jellyfish excrete a venom so dangerous that it can kill an adult in less than 5 minutes. The Irukandji jelly, the smallest known jellyfish in the world, is a member of the box jellyfish family. Box jellyfish are known to have a very strong venom. Their venom immediately attacks the heart, causing it to contract. Luckily, there is an antidote. Even polyps (jellyfish babies) have the ability to sting! Be careful!</p>
