			<h1 id="title1">How and What Jellyfish Eat</h1>
			<h2 class="title MainParagraph">Just like any other animal, jellyfish need nutrition in order to survive. They get their nutrients from many different sources. Jellyfish are known to eat many things and can digest many foods. What do jellyfish eat? How do jellyfish eat? How does a jellyfish poop?</h2>

						<p class="info">Jellyfish have special tentacles that carry food into the mouth of the jellyfish. These tentacles are called oral arms. All jellyfish have some form of oral tentacle that delivers food to the mouth. Jellyfish do not propel themselves towards food. Instead, they float and wait until food comes. Jellyfish do not have brains, so gathering food is relatively simple for them.</p>
						
						<p class="info">Most jellyfish are carnivorous and will eat things such as:</p>
							<ul class="info">
								<li class="list">Plankton</li>
								<li class="list">Small Fish</li>
								<li class="list">Larvae</li>
								<li class="list"> Shrimp</li>
							</ul>
						<p class="info">Some types of jellyfish are so big that they have the ability to eat crustaceans! Jellyfish can also eat other jellyfish. Jellyfish use their tentacles to gather food. When food comes into contact with a tentacle, the tentacle will inject venom into the food. The venom is how the jellyfish kills it’s food. Then, the oral arms will collect the food and deliver it to the mouth.</p>
						<p class="info">When food is delivered to the mouth, it is put into the stomach, where it is digested. That’s how simple it is! When the food is fully digested, the jellyfish will excrete it. However, the jellyfish does not have an organ that specializes in secreting waste. Instead, jellyfish poop out of their mouth! What a weird creature!</p>
