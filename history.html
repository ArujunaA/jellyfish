			<h1 id="title1">Jellyfish History and Life Cycle</h1>
			<h2 class="title MainParagraph">Jellyfish are very, very, VERY old creatures. In the beginning they were vulnerable, but as time went they began adapting to their habitat, growing stinger cells and organs. Now, jellyfish are the oldest known multi-organ animal, predating dinosaurs and sharks. What is the history of a jellyfish? What is the life cycle of a jellyfish?</h2>
				<!--This website uses flexboxes to format information-->

						<p class="info">Believe it or not, but the jellyfish has been around for at least 500 million years and up to 700 million years! This means that the jellyfish is the oldest living multi organ animal in the world, older than the dinosaurs! However, it is hard to find the actual date as jellyfish fossils are very rare. Jellyfish do not have any bones or any hard material in their body, so fossils can be uncommon.</p>
						
						<p class="info">The life cycle of a jellyfish is interestingly complex. A female jellyfish does not give birth to jellyfish. Instead, they give birth to small planula larvae. These larvae are covered in a hair called cilia, which helps them swim. These larvae attach themselves to a surface and transform into a polyp. </p>

						<p class="info">Polyps are cylindrical stalks with a mouth and tentacles. As a polyp grows it buds new polyps, forming a polyp colony. These polyp colonies eventually bud off baby jellyfish, or ephyra. The ephyra will then grow into a medusa, an adult jellyfish and the ones we know of.</p>
