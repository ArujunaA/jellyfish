			<h1 id="title1">How Humans Use Jellyfish</h1>
			<h2 class="title MainParagraph">Do humans use jellyfish? Well, yes. Jellyfish have been floating around for millions of years. Of course we have found a use for them. However, we are still discovering new ways to use jellyfish. Whether it's in the medicinal field, the medical field or the culinary field, jellyfish are very important to humans. How do humans use jellyfish? What do we use them for?</h2>

						<p class="info">Believe it or not, us humans have been using jellyfish for centuries! Jellyfish have many important uses in the culinary and the medical industry.</p>
						
						<p class="info">Many regions in the world consider jellyfish as a delicacy. Millions of pounds of jellyfish are exported from coasts to countries in Asia and Oceania. Many jellyfish produce a sting, however, the jellyfish that humans eat don’t produce a sting that is harmful to us. Jellyfish are prepared in many different ways. In China, jellyfish is eaten as an appetizer. Jellyfish are washed and pickled/salted to remove their water content. This also changes the texture, from gelatinous to rubbery. It is eaten in salads with chili/scallion oil or sauteed.</p>

						<p class="info">Jellyfish are also used in the medical field. Jellyfish, especially highly dangerous ones, are used to create antidotes and ointments that deal with jellyfish stings. Scientists also research jellyfish to see how their venom travels around the body. Bioluminescent (light-producing) jellyfish are also important. Scientists have been able to isolate the bioluminescent gene that certain jellyfish have and insert it into human cells. This makes it easier for scientists to track the development of cancers and diseases.</p>
