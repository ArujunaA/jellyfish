			<h1 id="title1">Where Jellyfish Live</h1>
			<h2 class="title MainParagraph">Jellyfish are very old creatures, with their history dating back to at least 500 million years and 700 million years at most. These creatures survived because of the habitat and the climate they grew up in. The type of habitat is very important to a jellyfish as the wrong climate/habitat could kill the jellyfish. Where do jellyfish live? Is there a specific temperature that jellyfish like?</h2>

						<p class="info">Jellyfish live all around the world. Some types of jellyfish live near the surface to feed off of leaves and algae. Other types of jellyfish live deep in the ocean, illuminating wonderful colors. Jellyfish are everywhere, from the sunny shores of a beach to the darkest depths of the ocean.</p>
						
						<p class="info">Most jellyfish live in saltwater in lukewarm temperatures. A jellyfish moving into a different body of water with a different temperature can harm and potentially kill the jellyfish. Jellyfish constantly migrate, moving to different parts of the ocean through currents. Currents are how jellyfish travel vertically. Jellyfish migrate in groups called a smack. Jellyfish smacks will often migrate to places with a lot of organic material and plankton.</p>

						<p class="info">Some jellyfish like to live in the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean. The Lion’s Mane jellyfish (the largest jellyfish in the world) is known to float around the cold waters of the Arctic Ocean. The Colobonema Sericeum is a deep-sea jellyfish that can be found 1500 meters down. The box jellyfish can be found in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia, especially around the coasts of Australia. The box jellyfish kills dozens of people each year and many more are injured.</p>
