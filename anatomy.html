			<h1 id="title1">The Anatomy of a Jellyfish</h1>
			<h2 class="title MainParagraph">Jellyfish are unique creatures with very unique anatomies. Unlike mammals and reptiles, jellyfish can still survive without vital organs. They can sense predators and prey but they have no eyes. They can move around and swim for long periods of time, yet they don't have a heart. How can they do this? How can they sense animals?</h2>

						<p class="info">The anatomy of a jellyfish is relatively simple compared to the anatomy of a human. Jellyfish only have a couple of organs and a simple nervous system. On the outside, jellyfish have a bell-shaped body and tentacles that are attached to the bell part.</p>

						<p class="info">The bell is the most important part of the jellyfish. It acts as a body and contains the organs of a jellyfish. Jellyfish have stomachs, mouths,  but no digestive organs such as the liver, pancreas or intestines. Jellyfish have 2 cell layers, the epidermis (outer layer) and the gastrodermis (inner layer). The epidermis of a jellyfish contains a simple nervous system that lets the jellyfish see and sense pressure. Jellyfish also have eyes, however, they are very rudimentary. Some scientists believe that certain types of jellyfish have the ability to perceive and see color!</p>

						<p class="info"> The gastrodermis is the inner layer and lines the gut of the jellyfish. Inside the bell is a small region that contains the mouth and the stomach of the jellyfish. The mouth of the jellyfish is located underneath the bell. The mouth is very unique, as it acts as a food receptacle and a waste ejector. This means that jellyfish eat and poop out of their mouth! Between the epidermis and the gastrodermis is a substance called mesoglea. Mesoglea is 95% water, which helps jellyfish move underwater. This also makes jellyfish lightweight. Jellyfish have learned over the years to digest their food quickly, as holding too much waste can cause them to sink. Jellyfish also have gonads, which are it’s reproductive organs.</p>

						<p class="info">Jellyfish have 2 main tentacles, regular tentacles and oral tentacles. The tentacles are covered with thousands of cells called cnidocytes. Cnidocytes are tiny cells that eject venom when they come into contact with an object or a predator. Jellyfish have 4-8 oral arms. These arms are used to carry food into the mouth. Oral arms are covered in another stinging cell called nematocysts. Under a microscope, nematocysts eject a tiny, venomous harpoon when it comes into contact with something.</p>
